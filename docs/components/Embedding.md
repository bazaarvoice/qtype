### Embedding

A standard, built-in representation of a vector embedding.

- **vector** (`list[float]`): The vector representation of the embedding.
- **source_text** (`str | None`): The original text that was embedded.
- **metadata** (`dict[str, str] | None`): Optional metadata associated with the embedding.
